## About The Project

As part of our Industrial Project, our group of 4 was teamed with [Adaptivity](https://adaptivity.us/aboutus/). Tasked in recreating the work flow from the Digital Assessment to a force graph based on their results from the assessment.

Using [Typeform ](https://www.typeform.com/product/), a code-free web based platform to create surveys, makes arranging logics of surveys and collecting results with ease. 

With storing the assessment results in MongoDB in mind, we decided on [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/en/integrations/mongodb/typeform) for the integration from Typeform to MongoDB.
